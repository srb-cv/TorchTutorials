Below provided links are helpful for learning to implement Deep Learning architectures in Torch. As Torch uses Lua programming lanuage, it becomes essential to learn it. Lua is very easy programming language and can be easily understood by people having knowledge of any OOP supporting language.

# TorchTutorials

1. General overview of Torch packages is very well collated at [this site](https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/README.md)
2. For Deep Learning nn reading about nn package is a must. This can be found at [this site](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/README.md)
Also, if someone want to search for a particular thing in Torch nn package, can refer to [this site](https://nn.readthedocs.io/en/rtd/index.html) with searhable contents.

# LuaTutorials

1. Comprehensive Lua Tutorials can now be found on [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/)
2. One can also read the online available book [Programming in Lua](http://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html), which is not  difficult to understand.
3. A very helpful [Lua cheatsheet](http://lua-users.org/files/wiki_insecure/users/thomasl/luarefv51single.pdf)
4. [Lua Reference Mannal 5.3](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/)

All the Best!
