All useful links, collaborated at one site for ease of learning

1. General overview of Torch packages is very well collated at [this site](https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/README.md)
2. For Deep Learning nn reading about nn package is a must. This can be found at [this site](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/README.md)
Also, if someone want to search for a particular thing in Torch nn package, can refer to [this site](https://nn.readthedocs.io/en/rtd/index.html) with searhable contents.
